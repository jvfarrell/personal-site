      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I am a Hip-Hop dancing snowboarder with a love for lacrosse, soccer, and video games. You can usually find me playing League of Legends or out and about exploring Northern Virginia with my girlfriend.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I graduated from the College of William & Mary in 2014 with my Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Process Management and Consulting.
        My first 2 years out of school I worked down in Richmond VA at Genworth Financial in a development program trying out different technical roles.
        In August of 2016 I moved up to Arlington VA and started working for Ventera as a technical Consultant.  I worked on the FNS contract for several months and have recently transitioned to the CMS contract.</p>

      <h1>About this site</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This site contains several of my personal projects to show off some things I've worked on.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Check out each link to see what that project does.  I'll continually update them.
        If you want to know more about me personally check out my social media below and check out my YouTube channel.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><u>Quote Generator:</u> I love to collect things.  Since I was little I collected geodes from the Outer Banks.
        Over the past several years I've collected and written down my favorite quotes.  The quote generator will randomly select
        one of my favorite quotes that I have collect each time you refresh the page.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><u>Summoner Lookup:</u> I love video games.  I've grown up playing Halo, CoD, Gears of War, etc with my Dad and brothers.
        League of Legends is one of my current favorites, so I decided to make a League of Legends Profiler. It currently
        displays some basic stats about your top 8 ranked champions. It pulls all the data from the Riot API.
        I'll be working on this one a lot to add more features and fix bugs continuously.
