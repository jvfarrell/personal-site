      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I am a Hip-Hop dancing snowboarder with a love for lacrosse, soccer, and video games. You can usually find me playing League of Legends or out and about exploring Northern Virginia with my girlfriend.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I graduated from the College of William & Mary in 2014 with my Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Process Management and Consulting.
        My first 2 years out of school I worked down in Richmond VA at Genworth Financial in a development program trying out different technical roles.
        In August of 2016 I moved up to Arlington VA and started working for Ventera as a technical Consultant.  I worked on the FNS contract for several months and have recently transitioned to the CMS contract.</p>
